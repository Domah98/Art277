        <h2 class="h2">Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food
          insecurity, using technology to empower community organizations and
          local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in need.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="h2">How we help</h2>
        <p>
          Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our
          volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and
          essential supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes
          <img class="man" src="images/notice.jpg" alt="man" /> community
          volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive solution
          for partners to scale their own impact. <br />
          <br />
          Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch
          requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we connect
          individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.
          <br /><br />
          Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second
          Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer
          shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale.
          We've grown the number of people we can help by working together—and
          we are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our
          mission.
