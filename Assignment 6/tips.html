        <h2><q>Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19</q></h2>
        <p>
          As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county,
          people who are fully vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal
          fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let
          your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance
          that you could become infected. <br /><br />
          Dr. Cardona explains. <br /><br />
          <q>
            Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series
            as recommended for the best protection against severe complications
            such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
            protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to
            fight off the infectious consequences of being exposed to the
            SARS-CoV2 virus.</q
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
          including other vaccinated people?
        </h2>
        <p>
          While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit
          COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a
          reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.
          <br />
          <q>
            The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those
            with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective
            response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still
            collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine
            responses in these vulnerable populations.</q
